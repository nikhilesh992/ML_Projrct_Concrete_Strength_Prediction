# ML_Projrct_Concrete_Strength_Prediction
I look at The data and I see That i need to Find The best indipendent variable That is corelated to our dependent variable for that I Perform ML Supervised Regression Models To Predict the Data and found the Best Model.

Concrete Strength Prediction Perform Below algorithms To Predict The data And Found the Best Model: 
- Linear Regression 
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- KNN Regressor
- SVM Regressor 
- AND 
- Pick each of the algorithm and perform Below steps: 
- Split your data between train and test steps.  
- Build The model  List down the evaluation metrics you would use to evaluate the performance of  the model? 
- Evaluate the model on training data
- Predict the response variables for the test data  
- How are the two scores? Are they significantly different? Are they the same? Is  the test score better than training score?
