# ML_Projrct_Concrete_Strength_Prediction
Concrete Strength Prediction Perform Below algorithms To Predict The data And Found the Best Model: 
- Linear Regression 
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- KNN Regressor
- SVM Regressor 
- AND 
- Pick each of the algorithm and perform Below steps: 
- Split your data between train and test steps.  
- Build The model  List down the evaluation metrics you would use to evaluate the performance of  the model? 
- Evaluate the model on training data
- Predict the response variables for the test data  
- How are the two scores? Are they significantly different? Are they the same? Is  the test score better than training score?
